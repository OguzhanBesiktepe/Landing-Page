This Webpage showcases a 3D Printed Mini PC (that contains a Raspberry Pi 4 and 1080P HD Display)
The Pictures, Parts, and Details listed on the webpage are all from yours truly.
I configured the PC to run Octoprint, and now am able to view/control my 3D Printer conveniently.

The Design of the 3D Printed Desktop is from: https://www.printables.com/model/694802-retro-desktop-pc-raspberry-pi-case-v2
