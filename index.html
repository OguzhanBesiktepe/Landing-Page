            This mini PC was Fully 3D Printed & Assembled.
            It runs primarily off a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB) and currently has OctoPrint Installed!
            This software allows me to control my 3D Printer via LAN or WAN and make Prints with my Desktop and Mobile Device.
            The screen was an additional add-on feature that made the PC look more complete.

             <!-- This is the end of first big header of the webpage 
            Next Will Contain More Information about the Printer Used, Build Process, & Materials-->

            <div class = "Text-One" > 

            The Design was found on Printables (created by fantasticmrdavid)
            The Parts are all separated and are required to be screwed together
            with multiple KM Flat Head Philips Screws. </div>

            <div class = "Image-Two" > <img src="" /></div>
            <div class = "Text-Two" > 

            The Printing Process was done on a Creality Ender 3 V2 Neo
            With Cura Slicing Software to adjust my Printers Settings.

            <div class = "Text-Three" > 
            
            The Electronics are a Rasberry Pi 4 and a 1080P HD Screen.
            This PC is currently running the latest iteration OctoPrint Software (v 1.9.3)
            With this software I am able to view my printer's settings (Temperatures, Axis, Printing Speeds)
            As well as view prints in real-time via a USB Camera.
