            This mini PC was Fully 3D Printed & Assembled.
            It runs primarily off a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB) and currently has OctoPrint Installed!
            This software allows me to control my Printer on my LAN and make Prints on my Desktop and Mobile Device.
            The screen was an additional add-on feature that made the PC look more complete.
