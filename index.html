            <p> This mini PC was fully 3D Printed & Assembled.
            It runs primarily off a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB) and currently has OctoPrint Installed on a Micro-SD Card.
            This software allows the user to control their 3D Printer on either a LAN or WAN connection. </p> </div>

            The Design is listed on Printables (by fantasticmrdavid)
            The Parts are all separated and are required to be screwed together
            with multiple KM Flat Head Philips Screws. </div>

            <div class = "Image-Two" > <img src="" /></div>
            <div class = "Text-Two" > 

            The Printing Process was done on a Creality Ender 3 V2 Neo
            With Cura Slicing Software to adjust Printers Settings.

            <div class = "Image-Three" > <img src="/Users/oguzhanbesiktepe/repos/odin-LandingPage/Pictures/Rasberry Pi View.HEIC" /></div>
            <div class = "Text-Three" > 
            
            The Electronics are a Rasberry Pi 4 and a 3.5 Inch 1080P HD Screen (MPI3508).
            Necessary cables include a Ribbon Cable & Micro-HDMI to HDMI Converter.

            This PC is currently running the latest iteration OctoPrint Software (v 1.9.3).
            With this software I am able to view my printer's settings (Temperatures, Axis, Printing Speeds).
            Alongside view prints in real-time via a USB Webcam.
